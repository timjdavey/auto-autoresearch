"""
train.py — Facility location solver. THIS IS THE FILE THE AGENT MODIFIES.

Contains a single function `solve(opening_costs, assign_costs)` that takes
facility opening costs and an assignment cost matrix, and returns an assignment
of clients to facilities.

Current implementation: greedy nearest (baseline).
The agent should improve this to maximise avg_improvement across all instances.

    Solve the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem.
